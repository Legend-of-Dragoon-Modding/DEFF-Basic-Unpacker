# DEFF-Basic-Unpacker 0.1
DEFF Basic Unpacker is a tool for Unpack the DEFF files from the game TLoD,
as a first project it works!, anyway, for now only support 1 file input!, so stay tuned for Updates!.

Just open with Python in a commmand prompt 
write the path to the file deff_basic_unpacker.py, and execute!.

for now only one command is possible:
Path_to_DEFF_file.

example: C:\loddump\deff.bin

the tool will provide some useful information about the file. Such size in Bytes, number of folders, subfolders and number of files!.
also it will create a folder in the same DEFF file folder, where the files are unpacked!.


i want to thanks a lot to this people who came my main inspiration to learn programming!:
